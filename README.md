    <h1> How to contribute to this project: </h1>
    
    <p> I need help to organize the archives with a better software architeture, to translate the project to english and display the results in a file in PDF. </p>
    
    <h1> Known bugs:</h1>
    
    <ul>
    <li>  In a few cases principally with 5x5 system that doesn't have a PQ bar the program can't evaluate the power flow. </li>
    <li> The program can't generate a new PDF file with the newest results. </li>
    </ul>
